[[Aeneid 1]] 
Aeneus is escaping Troy with 20 ships of men after the city is sacked by the Greeks. Juno petitions Aeolus (god of the winds) to wreck their ships. Juno is the Patroness of the Carthaginians. A prophecy holds that a race descended from the Trojans will one day destroy Carthage. 

Jupiter reveals his plan for Aeneus to Venus, his mother.  She comes to him despondent, worried that Jupiter has changed his mind about Aeneus, seeing how much disaster he must go through. He tells her that he hasn't changed his mind and tells of home Romulus and Remus, Julius, and Augustus will all come from Aeneus' line.

She goes to Aeneus on the coast of Libya, and tells him about the Phoenician settlement nearby and about Dido their queen.  She was the daughter of the king of Phoenicia who married a very rich man, Sychaeus. Her brother, Pygmalion, killed her husband to get his wealth and lead Dido on to believe that her husband was still alive. The ghost of Sychaeus went to Dido in a dream and told her his fate and where his "untold tons of silver and gold" were buried. She gathers all those who hate the tyrant or love her and the buried metals and escapes to Carthage, in northern Africa. 

Aeneus then goes into the city of Carthage, but is shrouded by a veil of mist so that none see him enter. He sees some of his fellow trojans, those who were believed to have been lost at sea, petitioning Dido for safe harbor.  He lets the veil drop, and addresses the queen as well as his lost companions. Dido gives them gifts of sacrificial bulls and threw them a banquet to celebrate the end of their journey. 

Venus schemes with Cupid to make Dido fall in love with Aeneus, "she will be bound by me, bound by her great love for my Aeneus". During the banquet, Cupid, disguised as Aeneus' son Ascanius, begins to "blot out Sychaeus and tried to captivate with a living passion her slumbering soul and her heart long unused." She then asked Aeneus all about Troy and the wars for it. Eventually she asked him to tell the whole story from beginning to end.
