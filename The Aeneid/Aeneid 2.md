Line 801-806:
	```                        A strange portent
	Flickered between the faces and hands
	Of Iulus' anxious parent: a light tongue of flame
	Fleaming above his head. Harmless to the touch,
	It licked his soft locks and grazed his temples.
	Trempling with fear, we shook the fore from his hair
	Quickly and doused the holy flames with water.```
