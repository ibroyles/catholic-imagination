Line 684-710

	Now Juno put the finishing touches 
	On her nascent war. A company of shepherds
	Poured into the city from the battlefield,
	Bearing the dead - the boy Almo
	And Galaesus' mangled body. They called
	On the gods and held Latinus to account.
	Turnus was there, and amid the riot,
	The passions, and the shouts of 'Murder!'
	He multiplied their terror: "Teucrians
	Are called in to rule! We are becoming
	Phrygian half-breeds, and I am shut out!"
	
	The Bacchic women were still in their frenzy
	Mothers dancing through the trackless woods-
	The name of Amata carried some weight.
	And now their men were coming together
	From all sides, wearying Mars with their pleas.
	Degying the omens and the sacred oracles,
	Their minds twisted, they all clamored
	For an unholy war. Latinus' palace
	Was soon besieged by an ugly crowd. 
	He stood as a cliff stands on a ocean shore,
	
	...
	
	But when he saw that he was powerless
	To change their resolve, that was all that was going
	As cruel Juno wished, old Latinus
	Called the gods and the empty air to witness


When I read this, I immediately thought of the scene in the Passion of the Lord when Jesus is brought before Pilate and the crowd is yelling, "Crucify him, crucify him!".  I have come to believe that all the pagan "gods" were just demons. This adds a layer to the parallels.  Here we have a god, Juno, meddling in the affairs of men, causing division and strife between two groups of people, leading to bloodshed and death.  The line I particularly see that connects the two is the second stanza from above, "Their minds twisted, they all clamored For an unholy war."  In the Passion, Satan, presumably, kickstarted the frenzy of the crowd, twisting their minds to pardon Barabas instead of Christ. "The crowd was clamoring for an unholy war", we see this in the Passion narrative as well. The Crucifixion is not a war in and of itself, but I read the narrative as Satan viewing Christ's death as a victory in his unholy war for Humanities soul.
